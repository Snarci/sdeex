Welcome to the ** sdeex: Simplify Deep Learning Experiments** repository! This project allows you to classify images, extract features using deep learning models, evaluate them, and visualize embeddings using UMAP and PCA techniques. Many more functionalities are on the way!

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify images using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from images using various deep learning backbones, including Vision Transformers.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate extracted features using a set of metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generate and visualize UMAP and PCA embeddings.

## Tasks You Can Do
1. **Classify Images**  
   Run the classification pipeline to classify images using pretrained models. The code allows easy customization for different models and datasets.

2. **Extract Features from Images**  
   Extract deep features from images using models like ResNet, Vision Transformer, etc.

3. **Evaluate Features**  
   Evaluate the extracted features using K-NN

4. **Generate UMAP Embeddings**  
   Reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features using UMAP and visualize them.

5. **Generate PCA Embeddings**  
   Use PCA to generate and visualize embeddings from Vision Transformer features.


## Installation
To run the code, first install the required dependencies. 
1. Install torch, torchaudio and torchvision from [Torch start locally]([https://example.com/documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))

2. For a quick install of all other packages, you can use the following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
